  <legend>What is it?</legend>

  <p>Photos in the Piwigo demo are coming from Piwigo users all over the world. The idea is to have high quality and fresh content in the demo and give credits to Piwigo community for this contribution.</p>

  <p>In the demo, on the page of the photo, you will see a "contributed by" info with a link to the contributor website. This link will provide visibility to your Piwigo from humans and search engines as well.</p>

  <p><img src="plugins/contribute_to_demo/images/contributed-by.jpg"></p>

  <p>Once duplicated in the demo, you give permission to the Piwigo demo for displaying your photo. As a contributor, you keep the ownership of your photos. At any time, you can remove your photo with a single and immediate action.</p>

  <p>We hope you'll love the idea and decide to become a contributor yourself. The Piwigo project needs you to create the most appealing demo. A nice demo will attract more users. More users means more improvements to make Piwigo even more awesome!</p>
